# Python Student Classification System

A Python-based academic classification system that calculates weighted scores and automatically assigns degree classifications based on predefined thresholds.

Developed using Jupyter Notebook.

---

## Project Overview

This project implements a structured grading algorithm that processes student assessment components, applies weighted calculations, and assigns a final academic category.

The system demonstrates:

- Weighted score computation
- Conditional classification logic
- Structured data handling
- Clear algorithmic implementation
- Reproducible calculation workflow

---

## Classification Logic

The system:

1. Accepts assessment component scores
2. Applies predefined weighting rules
3. Computes an overall weighted result
4. Assigns a final category (e.g., First, Upper Second, Lower Second, etc.)

The classification thresholds are defined within the algorithm to ensure consistency and accuracy.
